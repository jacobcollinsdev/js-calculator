This is a simple JavaScript Calculator.

Things learned:
1. Using data* HTML attribute  can make it easier to see what elements are being used for JavaScript and which ones are being used for CSS.
2. Grid-column (start/end), use 1/-1 to make an element span from first column to the last.
3. First time creating an object, initialising properties with a constructor, and defining methods within.
